Avengers: Infinity War is a 2018 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to 2012's The Avengers and 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron, and the nineteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, and features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Don Cheadle, Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, Dave Bautista, Zoe Saldana, Josh Brolin, and Chris Pratt. In the film, the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy attempt to stop Thanos from amassing the all-powerful Infinity Stones.

The film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War – Part 1. The Russo brothers came on board to direct in April 2015 and by May, Markus and McFeely had signed on to write the script for the film, which drew inspiration from Jim Starlin's 1991 The Infinity Gauntlet comic and Jonathan Hickman's 2013 Infinity comic. In 2016, Marvel shortened the title to Avengers: Infinity War. Filming began in January 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, with a large cast consisting mostly of actors reprising their roles from previous MCU films. The production lasted until July 2017, shooting back-to-back with an untitled direct sequel. Additional filming took place in Scotland, England, the Downtown Atlanta area, and New York City. With an estimated budget in the range of $316–400 million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made.

Avengers: Infinity War held its world premiere on April 23, 2018 in Los Angeles and was released in the United States on April 27, 2018, in IMAX and 3D. The film received praise for the performances of the cast (particularly Brolin's) and the emotional weight of the story, as well as the visual effects and action sequences. It was the fourth film and the first superhero film to gross over $2 billion worldwide, breaking numerous box office records and becoming the highest-grossing film of 2018, as well as the fourth-highest-grossing film of all time and in the United States and Canada. The currently untitled sequel is set to be released on May 3, 2019.

Plot:
------
Having acquired the Power Stone from the planet Xandar, Thanos and his lieutenants—Ebony Maw, Cull Obsidian, Proxima Midnight, and Corvus Glaive—intercept a spaceship carrying the last survivors of Asgard. As they extract the Space Stone from the Tesseract, Thanos subdues Thor, overpowers Hulk, and kills Loki. Heimdall sends Hulk to Earth using the Bifröst before being killed. Thanos departs with his lieutenants and obliterates the ship.

Hulk crash-lands at the Sanctum Sanctorum in New York City, reverting to Bruce Banner. He warns Stephen Strange and Wong about Thanos' plan to kill half of all life in the universe; in response, Strange recruits Tony Stark. Maw and Obsidian arrive to retrieve the Time Stone from Strange, drawing the attention of Peter Parker. Maw captures Strange, but fails to take the Time Stone due to an enchantment. Stark and Parker pursue Maw's spaceship, Banner contacts Steve Rogers, and Wong stays behind to guard the Sanctum.

In Edinburgh, Midnight and Glaive ambush Wanda Maximoff and Vision in order to retrieve the Mind Stone in Vision's forehead. Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and Sam Wilson rescue them and take shelter with James Rhodes and Banner at the Avengers Compound. Vision offers to sacrifice himself by having Maximoff destroy the Mind Stone to keep Thanos from retrieving it. Rogers suggests they travel to Wakanda, which he believes has the resources to remove the stone without destroying Vision.

The Guardians of the Galaxy respond to a distress call from the Asgardian ship and rescue Thor, who surmises Thanos seeks the Reality Stone, which is in the possession of the Collector on Knowhere. Rocket and Groot accompany Thor to Nidavellir, where they and Eitri create a battle-axe capable of killing Thanos. On Knowhere, Peter Quill, Gamora, Drax, and Mantis find Thanos with the Reality Stone already in his possession. Thanos kidnaps Gamora, his adoptive daughter, who reveals the location of the Soul Stone to save her captive adoptive sister Nebula from torture. Thanos and Gamora travel to Vormir, where Red Skull, keeper of the Soul Stone, informs him the stone can only be retrieved by sacrificing someone he loves. Thanos reluctantly kills Gamora, earning the stone.

Nebula escapes captivity and asks the remaining Guardians to meet her on Thanos' destroyed homeworld, Titan. Stark and Parker kill Maw and rescue Strange. Landing on Titan, they meet Quill, Drax, and Mantis. The group forms a plan to remove Thanos' Infinity Gauntlet after Strange uses the Time Stone to view millions of possible futures, seeing only one in which Thanos loses. Thanos arrives, justifying his plans as necessary to ensure the survival of a universe threatened by overpopulation. The group subdues him until Nebula deduces that Thanos has killed Gamora. Enraged, Quill attacks him, allowing Thanos to break the group's hold and overpower them. Stark is seriously wounded by Thanos, but is spared after Strange surrenders the Time Stone to Thanos.

In Wakanda, Rogers reunites with Bucky Barnes before Thanos' army invades. The Avengers, alongside T'Challa and the Wakandan forces, mount a defense while Shuri works to extract the Mind Stone from Vision. Banner, unable to transform into the Hulk, fights in Stark's Hulkbuster armor. Thor, Rocket, and Groot arrive to reinforce the Avengers; Midnight, Obsidian, and Glaive are killed and their army is routed. Thanos arrives and despite Maximoff's attempt to destroy the Mind Stone, removes it from Vision's head, killing him.

Thor severely wounds Thanos, but Thanos activates the completed Infinity Gauntlet and teleports away. Half of all life across the universe disintegrates, including Barnes, T'Challa, Groot, Maximoff, Wilson, Mantis, Drax, Quill, Strange, and Parker, as well as Maria Hill and Nick Fury, although Fury is able to transmit a signal first.[N 1] Stark and Nebula remain on Titan while Banner, M'Baku, Okoye, Rhodes, Rocket, Rogers, Romanoff, and Thor are left on the Wakandan battlefield. Meanwhile, Thanos watches a sunrise on another planet.

CAST:
-----
Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man: 
The leader and benefactor of the Avengers, who is a self-described genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist with electromechanical suits of armor of his own making.[8][9] Co-director Joe Russo explained that Stark "senses this greater threat approaching, so he is doing everything in his power to keep the Earth safe".[10] Downey added that Stark would have smaller goals than in previous films.[11]
Chris Hemsworth as Thor: 
An Avenger and the king of Asgard, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name.[12] Joe Russo stated that Thor's storyline picks up after the events of Thor: Ragnarok (2017), which finds him in a "very profound... very interesting place" with "real emotional motivation".[13] At the recommendation of Hemsworth, writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely consulted Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi and screenwriter Eric Pearson to help carry over the comedic and tragic elements of the re-toned Thor from that film.[14] Joe Russo said that Thor has "the driving hero's arc of the movie which stands in direct opposition to Thanos' argument" and would have been the main protagonist of the film had Thor killed Thanos.[15]
Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / Hulk: 
An Avenger and a genius scientist who, because of exposure to gamma radiation, transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated.[16][17] Banner spends the film trying to reintegrate with the Avengers, and also tries to "impress upon everybody how dangerous Thanos is".[18] Joe Russo felt the Hulk refusing to appear for much of the film was only partially because he was scared, but also because he realizes that "Banner only wants Hulk for fighting. I think he's had enough of saving Banner's ass." Russo added that this was "really reflective of the journey from Ragnarok... [where] these two characters are constantly in conflict with each other over control."[19] Banner's appearance in the film continues a story arc for the character that was established in Thor: Ragnarok and concludes in the Infinity War sequel,[20] with the difference between Hulk and Banner "starting to blur a little bit". Ruffalo described Hulk in Infinity War as having the mental capacity of a five-year-old.[18]
Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America: 
A fugitive superhero and leader of a faction of Avengers. A World War II veteran, he was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world.[12] Joe Russo said after the events of Captain America: Civil War (2016), Rogers struggles with the conflict between his responsibility to himself and his responsibility to others.[21] The character embodies the "spirit" of his comic alternate identity Nomad in the film,[22] and receives new vibranium gauntlets from Shuri to replace his traditional shield.[23] An early draft of the film experimented with Rogers first appearing in the film saving Vision from Corvus Glaive's attack in Wakanda. Markus and McFeely said they were called "insane" for waiting that long to introduce Rogers into the film and ultimately conceded it was "not [a] satisfying" approach.[24]
Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: 
A highly trained spy, a member of Rogers' faction of Avengers, and a former agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.[25][26] Johansson said that Romanoff's situation in the aftermath of the events of Captain America: Civil War has been "a dark time. I wouldn't say that my character has been particularly hopeful, but I think she's hardened even more than she probably was before."[27]
Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Stephen Strange: 
A former neurosurgeon who, after a car accident that led to a journey of healing, discovered the hidden world of magic and alternate dimensions, and became a Master of the Mystic Arts.[28] Markus and McFeely described Strange as "[ending] up being the reasonable adult in the room" with the "widest perspective available" due to the film's stakes.[29] Aaron Lazar served as Cumberbatch's stand-in until the latter completed filming on The Current War (2017). At that point, Cumberbatch re-shot scenes where his face needed to be seen.[30] Julian "JayFunk" Daniels once again assisted Cumberbatch with his finger-tutting movements.[31]
Don Cheadle as James "Rhodey" Rhodes / War Machine: 
A colonel in the U.S. Air Force and Avenger who operates the War Machine armor.[32] Following his paralysis during the events of Civil War, Rhodes is given an apparatus by Stark to walk again, although he is reluctant to don his War Machine armor and rejoin the Avengers due to his injury. Cheadle believed that Rhodes is "negotiating this reunion and his rejoining this team". He also explained that Rhodes' relationship with Stark "deepened" from his accident, saying, "I think Tony feels somewhat responsible and culpable in a way. But again, he's always had my back in a way that only he could really have."[33]
Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man: 
A teenager and Stark's protegé who received spider-like abilities after being bitten by a genetically-modified spider.[10] Downey helped coach Holland through his death scene, which was not as drawn out in the script. Anthony Russo said, Downey "kept driving: put more and more emotion into it, and just went up to Tom and said, 'You don't want to go because you're a child. And you're using your strength as Spider-Man to fight this'. And then that was the performance that came out."[34]
Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther: 
The king of the African nation of Wakanda, who gained his enhanced strength by ingesting the Heart-Shaped Herb.[26][35] Boseman, along with the other actors from Black Panther (2018) portraying Wakandans, improvised their war chants on set ahead of the battle in Wakanda. Despite both Black Panther and Infinity War filming at the same time, the Russos were not aware of the chants, as they had not yet seen footage from Black Panther, and felt the moment was "incredibly cool".[36]
Paul Bettany as Vision: 
An android and Avenger created using the artificial intelligence J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron, and the Mind Stone.[28] Anthony Russo called Vision "a living MacGuffin. Obviously, that raises the stakes because Vision's life is in danger, and his life is in conflict with Thanos' goals, so something's got to give."[27]
Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch: A member of Rogers' faction of Avengers, who can harness magic and engage in hypnosis and telekinesis.[37]
Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Falcon: 
A member of Rogers' faction of Avengers and former pararescueman trained by the military in aerial combat, using a specially designed wing pack.[38] Mackie noted that Wilson has a grudge with other heroes like Iron Man and Black Panther after the events of Civil War.[27]
Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier: 
An enhanced soldier and Rogers' ally and best friend, who reemerged as a brainwashed assassin after being thought killed in action during World War II.[39] Barnes, who formerly went by Winter Soldier, is given the name White Wolf by the people of Wakanda, who helped remove his Hydra programming.[23]
Tom Hiddleston as Loki: Thor's adoptive brother, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name.[40]
Idris Elba as Heimdall: The all-seeing, all-hearing Asgardian former sentry of the Bifröst Bridge, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name.[41]
Peter Dinklage as Eitri: King of the Dwarves of Nidavellir, and weaponsmith, based on the Norse mythological dwarf of the same name.[42]
Benedict Wong as Wong: One of the Masters of the Mystic Arts, tasked with protecting some of Kamar-Taj's most valuable relics and books.[43]
Pom Klementieff as Mantis: A member of the Guardians of the Galaxy with empathic powers.[44]
Karen Gillan as Nebula: An adopted daughter of Thanos who was raised with Gamora as siblings.[45]
Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer: 
A member of the Guardians and warrior in search of vengeance against Thanos for killing his family.[46] At the end of each day of filming, Bautista would have to sit in a sauna to remove his makeup.[47]
Zoe Saldana as Gamora: A member of the Guardians, who is an orphan from an alien world and raised by Thanos, seeking redemption for her past crimes.[48] Ariana Greenblatt portrays a young Gamora.[49]
Vin Diesel as Groot: 
A member of the Guardians who is a tree-like humanoid.[50] Executive producer James Gunn explained that Groot is still an adolescent in the film, in the same state of growth seen in one of the post-credit scenes in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017).[51] Terry Notary provided motion capture for Groot, and said the character is "coming of age, so you'll see the teenager find a mentor to look up to and to model himself after".[52]
Bradley Cooper as Rocket: 
A member of the Guardians who is a genetically-engineered raccoon-based bounty hunter and mercenary, and is a master of weapons and battle tactics.[53] Sean Gunn was again the stand-in for Rocket during filming, with his acting and expressions serving as motion reference for the character.[54][55]
Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts: 
Stark's fiancée and the CEO of Stark Industries.[56] Downey felt that "Pepper remains the heart of the [Iron Man] story", which was not a focal point in some of the preceding films with Stark. Downey continued that "we wanted to get back to that reality. Not just for them, but let's really see how that can add to the something-worth-fighting-for of it all."[11]
Benicio del Toro as Taneleer Tivan / The Collector: One of the Elders of the Universe, who is an obsessive keeper of the largest collection of interstellar fauna, relics, and species of all manner in the galaxy.[57]
Josh Brolin as Thanos: 
An intergalactic despot from Titan who longs to collect all six of the Infinity Stones in order to impose his will on all of reality,[58][59][60] wanting to "re-balance the universe".[61] Producer Kevin Feige added that Thanos believes the universe is becoming over-populated, which led to the destruction of his home moon Titan and is something he vowed not to let happen again,[60] and also said "you could almost go so far as to say he is the main character of" the film.[62] McFeely shared this sentiment, describing the film as his "hero journey" in addition to being the film's protagonist, stating, "Part of that is the things that [mean] the most to him. We wanted to show that. It wasn't just power; it wasn't just an ideal; it was people."[29] Brolin likened Thanos to "the Quasimodo of this time" and the novel Perfume, since Thanos was born deformed and considered a "freak" on Titan,[63] while Joe Russo would reference The Godfather (1972) for Brolin at times, which Brolin felt helped "to emotionalize the whole thing".[64] Brolin further added that he preferred playing Thanos over Cable in Deadpool 2 (2018) because of the amount of work that went into creating the character.[65] Thanos does not wear armor for most of the film, which is symbolic of his growing power as he collects the Infinity Stones.[66] In addition to voicing for the character, Brolin performed motion capture on set.[67]
Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord: 
The half-human, half-Celestial leader of the Guardians who was abducted from Earth as a child, and raised by a group of alien thieves and smugglers called the Ravagers.[37] Pratt described his role in the film as "a cameo... you get to be a little more vibrant; a little more irreverent; a little bit more colorful if you want it to be".[68]
Additionally, several other actors reprise their MCU roles: Danai Gurira as Okoye, the head of the Dora Milaje;[69] Letitia Wright as T'Challa's sister Shuri;[70] William Hurt as Thaddeus Ross, the U.S. Secretary of State;[71] Kerry Condon as the voice of Stark's A.I. F.R.I.D.A.Y.;[72] Winston Duke as M'Baku, the leader of Wakanda's mountain tribe the Jabari; Florence Kasumba as Ayo, a member of the Dora Milaje;[73] Jacob Batalon as Parker's friend Ned;[74] Isabella Amara as Parker's classmate Sally;[75] Tiffany Espensen as Parker's classmate Cindy;[76] and Ethan Dizon as Parker's classmate Tiny.[77] Samuel L. Jackson and Cobie Smulders make uncredited cameos as Nick Fury and Maria Hill, the former director and deputy director of S.H.I.E.L.D, respectively, in the film's post-credits scene.[78]

Thanos' henchmen, known collectively in the comics as the Black Order and in the film as the "Children of Thanos",[79] include Terry Notary as Cull Obsidian,[80][81] Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Ebony Maw,[82][83] Carrie Coon as Proxima Midnight,[81] and Michael James Shaw as Corvus Glaive.[84] The foursome provided voices and motion-capture performances on set for their characters.[85][84] As Coon was pregnant during filming, she mainly did facial capture for Proxima Midnight with some motion-capture,[86] with stuntwoman Monique Ganderton standing-in and providing the rest on set.[87] Ebony Maw's look was inspired by the Marvel Comics character Mephisto, who appeared in the Infinity Gauntlet storyline.[88]

Ross Marquand portrays Johann Schmidt / Red Skull, the "Stonekeeper" and former Nazi commander of Hydra during World War II. Marquand replaces Hugo Weaving, who had expressed reluctance to reprise the character from Captain America: The First Avenger (2011).[42][89] Avengers co-creator Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance in the film as Parker's school bus driver,[42] while screenwriter Stephen McFeely cameos as Secretary Ross's aide.[90] Kenneth Branagh, the director of Thor (2011), voices an Asgardian distress caller in an uncredited cameo.[91] David Cross was invited to make a cameo appearance as Tobias Fünke, his character from the television sitcom Arrested Development, which the Russo brothers had previously worked on; this was prevented by a scheduling conflict, but Fünke still appears in the film as a specimen in the Collector's collection, played by an uncredited extra.[92] Jon Favreau was to reprise his role as Happy Hogan, while co-director Joe Russo had a cameo appearance as a paparazzi photographer, but this scene did not make the theatrical cut of the film.[93]

Production
-----------
In October 2014, Marvel announced a two-part sequel to Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), titled Avengers: Infinity War. Part 1 was scheduled to be released on May 4, 2018, with Part 2 scheduled for May 3, 2019.[94][95] In April 2015, Marvel announced that Anthony and Joe Russo would direct both parts of Avengers: Infinity War,[96] with back-to-back filming expected to begin in 2016.[97] The next month, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely had signed on to write the screenplays for both parts of the film,[98] which draws inspiration from Jim Starlin's 1991 "The Infinity Gauntlet" comic and Jonathan Hickman's 2013 "Infinity" comic.[99] Anthony Russo added the film was inspired by 1990s heist films, with Thanos "on a smash-and-grab [to acquire the Infinity Stones], and everybody's trying to catch up the whole movie".[60] Producer Kevin Feige said that the Infinity War films were subtitled Part 1 and Part 2 "because they [have] such shared elements, it felt appropriate... But I wouldn't call it one story that's cut in half. I would say it's going to be two distinct movies."[100] In May 2016, the Russos revealed that they would retitle the two films, to further remove the misconception that they were one large film split in two, with Joe stating, "The intention is we will change [the titles], we just haven't come up with [them] yet."[101] That July, Marvel revealed Part 1's title would be shortened to simply Avengers: Infinity War.[102]

Principal photography began on January 23, 2017,[103] under the working title Mary Lou,[104] at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia,[105] with Trent Opaloch as director of photography.[106] Infinity War, along with its sequel, were shot using IMAX/Arri 2D cameras, thus marking the first time that a Hollywood feature film was shot entirely with IMAX digital cameras.[107] In early February, Marvel confirmed the involvement of Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord, and Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man in the film.[10] Additional filming took place in Scotland beginning in February 2017. The filming occurred in Edinburgh, Glasgow and the Scottish Highlands,[108] with studio work taking place at Wardpark Studios in Cumbernauld.[109][110] Filming also began at Durham Cathedral in Durham, England in early May 2017.[111] In late June 2017, filming occurred in Downtown Atlanta,[112] as well as Atlanta's Central Park in early July,[113] before moving to Queens, New York in the middle of the month.[114] Filming concluded on July 14, 2017.[115] For the film's final scene, where Thanos emerges healed in a nipa hut, the filmmakers partnered with Indochina Productions, a studio based in Thailand, to acquire footage of the Banaue Rice Terraces at Ifugao, Philippines.[116]

Later in July 2017, Joe Russo stated there were a couple of unfinished scenes for Infinity War that would be shot "in the next few months".[117] In early March 2018, Disney moved the release of Infinity War in the United States to April 27, 2018, to have it be released the same weekend as some of its international markets.[118][119] Visual effects for the film were created by Industrial Light & Magic,[120] Framestore,[121] Method Studios,[122] Weta Digital, Double Negative, Cinesite, Digital Domain, Rise, Lola VFX, and Perception.[123] With an estimated budget in the range of $316–400 million,[3][4][5] it is one of the most expensive films ever made.[124] Evans and Hemsworth both earned $15 million for the film.[125]

Main article: Avengers: Infinity War (soundtrack)
In June 2016, Alan Silvestri, who composed the score for The Avengers (2012), was revealed to be returning to score both Infinity War and its sequel.[126] Silvestri started to record his score in January 2018,[127] and concluded in late March. Silvestri felt working on the film "was a really different experience than anything I'd done before, especially in regard to the approach and balancing quick shifts in tone".[128] Ludwig Göransson's theme from Black Panther is also used in the film.[129] Hollywood Records and Marvel Music released the soundtrack album digitally on April 27, 2018, with a release on physical formats following on May 18. Two versions were released, a regular and deluxe edition, with the deluxe edition featuring some extended and additional tracks.[130]

Marketing:
----------
In May 2017, Robert Downey Jr. and his philanthropic organization Random Act Funding partnered with Omaze to initiate a contest to benefit the organization. A randomly chosen winner from those that donated would receive an Infinity War set visit.[131] A life-sized statue of Thanos, created by Legacy Effects, was on display at D23 Expo 2017,[132] alongside statues of the Black Order / "Children of Thanos": Corvus Glaive, Proxima Midnight, Ebony Maw, and Cull Obsidian.[79] Additionally, Feige, Joe Russo, Downey, Brolin, Bettany, Olsen, Klementieff, Gillan, Bautista, Cheadle, Mackie, Cumberbatch, Stan, Holland, Boseman, Ruffalo, and Hemsworth appeared at D23 Expo to present a clip highlighting the 10 years of MCU films, along with footage from Infinity War.[32] The footage, which was screened exclusively for the panel,[133] received strong audience reaction, with fans "literally on their feet and jumping as the footage played".[133][134] Julia Alexander of Polygon commented, "to say that there was quite a bit happening in the trailer would be one hell of an understatement." She was excited that the film would deliver on the character interactions in one film and that Infinity War "finally feels like Marvel has made the movie it always wanted to—and the one we've always wanted to see. For nearly ten years we dreamt of this reality and to see it play across a massive screen... it was impossible to not feel emotional."[134] CinemaBlend's Eric Eisenberg said the footage left him "literally shaking", with the film looking "like it could be one of the most epic blockbusters ever created", concluding "the hype [for the film] most definitely feels very, very real".[135] Haleigh Foutch for Collider said, "It looks dark and dramatic, and utterly epic. It's clear Marvel is trying to do something different here... to pay off a decade's worth of narrative and world-building. While it's impossible to tell from two minutes work of footage, it certainly looks like that gamble paid off."[136] The D23 footage was also shown at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con International.[137] Due to the two convention presentations, Avengers: Infinity War generated over 90,000 new conversations on social media from July 17 to 23, the third-most during that time period behind Thor: Ragnarok and Justice League (2017), according to comScore and its PreAct service.[138] Infinity War stayed in third the following week, with over 41,000 new social media conversations, behind Ragnarok and It (2017).[139] By the week of October 16, Infinity War had generated over 679,000 total social media conversations.[140]

To promote the release of the film's first trailer, Marvel released "a retrospective video looking back at some of its best trailers" since Iron Man (2008), "paired with fan reaction videos to those trailers".[141] The first trailer for Avengers: Infinity War debuted on Good Morning America on November 29, 2017.[142] Josh Spiegel of The Hollywood Reporter said, "The trailer promises, in many ways, exactly what anyone with a passing familiarity with superhero movies would expect..." but "the most important part of the trailer is how it carefully, deliberately introduces the notion that the Infinity War films are going to function as a passing of the torch, from one set of Avengers to a newer group."[143] Scott Mendelson, writing for Forbes, noted that even though the trailer was not much different from the convention footage screened earlier in the year, it was "damn impressive. Moreover, it uses Nick Fury's big 'Avengers Initiative' speech, along with Alan Silvestri's Avengers theme, to excellent effect."[144] Conversely to Mendelson, Alexander commented on the different marketing strategy for the film between the convention footage scenes and the trailer scenes, feeling the "two couldn't be more different". She noted how the convention footage ("meant to please a crowd running on little sleep and jittery with anticipation") was released between Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) and Thor: Ragnarok, and "[i]t made sense to use Thor and the Guardians to hype up [Infinity War]" because "Marvel relied on the anticipation of Thor: Ragnarok and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2's success to excite fans, and footage of older movies set to classic Marvel scores as a way to drive home how this movie is an event in itself." Conversely, the trailer ("designed to explain what's about to happen, teasing it out with additional background") heavily featured Black Panther and Wakanda, which Alexander said could not have been done earlier, without the additional marketing for Black Panther that happened after the conventions to provide additional context.[145] Gael Cooper of CNET observed that the trailer was viewed nearly 500,000 times in its first 15 minutes after it was posted on YouTube, but questioned if the trailer broke the site after the view counter appeared to be stuck at 467,331.[146] The trailer was viewed 230 million times in its first 24 hours, becoming the most viewed trailer in that time period, surpassing the record of It.[147]

In January 2018, Marvel Comics published a two-issue prequel comic titled Avengers: Infinity War Prelude, which serves as a bridge between Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War.[148] A commercial for Infinity War aired during Super Bowl LII. The ad generated the most social media buzz out of all the films advertised during the Super Bowl, according to comScore and United Talent Agency; it was viewed 17.6 million times across YouTube and Facebook.[149] On February 27, 2018, Disney and Marvel announced the Marvel: The Universe Unites charity campaign leading to the release of merchandise for the film on March 3. The week-long event saw stars from the film create social media challenges to provide funds and raise awareness for charities that support children and families impacted by serious illness. If their collective posts reached 1 million likes, Marvel said they would make a $250,000 donation to Starlight Children's Foundation. Additionally, Disney planned to donate 10% of sales of all Marvel products purchased at Disney Stores in the United States and online on the weekend of March 3 to the Make-A-Wish Foundation, up to $50,000. Hasbro donated $1 million worth of cash and products to Give Kids the World Village and Funko made a $1 million toy donation to Starlight.[150]

A second trailer was released on March 16, 2018, which earned over 1 million views on YouTube in less than three hours after it was released.[151] Alyssa Rosenberg of The Washington Post was not overly enthused about another superhero film having "special-effects-heavy villains, or the sight of yet another mysterious object hanging over the Manhattan skyline", but felt the trailer made her realize "that I'm actually looking forward to seeing [the characters of the MCU] get to know each other".[152] Spiegel agreed with Rosenberg about the potential for character interactions, noting the trailer "suggests that some of these meetings are going to keep up the playful tone of recent MCU movies". While conceding it was "gimmicky" to have so many "crossover-style introductions or combinations of heroes in a movie like this", he noted "the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe is built on a foundation of these heroes existing within the same space, so their eventual meetings have a level of anticipation that exceeds that of watching them face off against Thanos."[153] The second trailer was viewed 179 million times in the first 24 hours, the third-most viewed trailer in that time period, behind the first trailer for the film and It, while also becoming the biggest release for a second trailer, surpassing Beauty and the Beast (2017) (128 million views).[154]

A week before the film's release, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai was lit up each night for the film, counting down to its release.[155] Marvel also featured tie-in events across seven of their mobile games to promote the film.[156] In early May 2018, Marvel and Epic Games announced the "Infinity Gauntlet Limited Time Mashup" mode for Fortnite Battle Royale, where players could find the Infinity Gauntlet hidden on the game map and become Thanos with added abilities. The Russo brothers were fans of Fortnite and approached Donald Mustard, the worldwide creative director of Epic Games, about the potential for a crossover between the properties.[157] On November 20, 2018, Little, Brown and Company will publish Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War: Thanos – Titan Consumed, written by Barry Lyga. Despite not existing within Marvel Studios' MCU canon, the novel explores the origins of Thanos before the events of the film. Lyga noted he spoke with Marvel Studios to get an "outline of who Thanos is and what he means to the movies", and "was given great latitude and a free hand [in some areas of the story], while in others I had to tip-toe very carefully through the MCU".[158]

Additional marketing partners for the film included Coca-Cola, Quicken Loans and their Rocket Mortgage service, the Infiniti QX50 (which is also featured in the film), Ziploc, Go-Gurt, Yoplait, Synchrony Bank, American Airlines, and Stand Up to Cancer. The partners created television commercials "inspired by or featuring the film's characters and themes", interactive digital initiatives, and robust in-store presences at numerous retailers. Duracell, Unilever, Quaker Oats Company, Chevron, and Samsung ran promotions in smaller markets. Coca-Cola, Ziploc, Go-Gurt, and Yoplait created special packaging in support of the film, with Synchrony implementing a "Save Like a Hero" campaign, and Stand Up to Cancer and American Airlines launching a national campaign with a PSA starring Johansson and Hemsworth. In the United Kingdom, OnePlus released an Infinity War edition for one of their smartphones. Deadline Hollywood estimated the media value was $150 million, the largest for any Marvel film, with Coca-Cola contributing an estimated $40 million.[159]

Avengers: Infinity War held its world premiere at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles on April 23, 2018, screening also at the adjacent El Capitan Theatre and Grauman's Chinese Theatre.[160] It was released in most countries worldwide, including the United States, on April 27, 2018, with a few debuts beginning as early as April 25,[118] and was shown in IMAX and 3D on select screens.[161][162] In the United States, the film opened in 4,474 theaters, 408 of which were IMAX; this was the widest release for a Disney title ever and the second-widest ever after Despicable Me 3's 4,529 theaters. Three of AMC Theatres' locations screened the film for 24 hours straight, with 53 of their locations having showtimes at either 2 am or 3 am to accommodate demand.[163] In India, the film had the biggest release ever for a Hollywood film, opening on nearly 2,000 screens in four languages.[164] The film also screened in 515 4DX theaters in 59 countries.[165] Avengers: Infinity War was originally scheduled to be released on May 4, 2018 in the United States.[94][95] The Chinese release of the film, which opened on May 11, 2018,[166] was originally scheduled to end on June 10, 2018, but was granted a "rare" extension of 30 days, to end on July 9, 2018.[167]

Select footage from the film was screened around various cities during the film's press tour in early April, ahead of the film's Los Angeles premiere. The Russos noted that only a limited amount of the film would be shown at these screenings to reduce the chance of spoilers being leaked. Adam Chitwood of Collider commented that this was "highly unusual as most Marvel movies are screened in their entirety for press about a month before they hit theaters".[168] Ahead of the United States release, AMC Theatres in New York City and Orlando, Florida aired an eleven-MCU film marathon beginning on April 25, leading to a screening of Infinity War. The El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles also had a similar marathon ahead of the film's release.[169]

Its worldwide opening weekend of $640.5 million is the biggest of all time, beating The Fate of the Furious' (2017) $541.9 million.[163] It crossed the $1 billion threshold at the worldwide box office in 11 days, becoming the fastest film to reach the milestone, eclipsing Star Wars: The Force Awakens' (2015) record of 12 days.[178] Also in its second weekend, Infinity War passed $13.5 million from 4DX screens, which was the all-time record for the format.[165] On June 12, 2018, Avengers: Infinity War passed the $2 billion mark at the worldwide box office, becoming the fourth film to cross that milestone after Avatar (2009), Titanic (1997), and The Force Awakens.[175] Crossing the mark in 48 days was the second fastest to that point, after Avatar's 47-day record.[179] With $140 million worldwide from IMAX,[180] the film is the third-largest worldwide in the format, behind Avatar and The Force Awakens,[174] and the largest gross for a Marvel film.[181] In May 2018, two weeks after its release, Deadline Hollywood deduced the film had already broken even, and estimated its net profit would be around $600 million, accounting for production budgets, P&A, talent participations and other costs, with box office grosses and ancillary revenues from home media.[3]

Pre-sale ticket records
In December 2017, a survey from Fandango indicated that Infinity War was the most anticipated film of 2018.[182] Fandango reported that Infinity War achieved the largest initial 24-hour ticket pre-sales for a superhero film in just six hours, surpassing the record from Black Panther. Atom Tickets also reported that Infinity War sold more tickets in its first pre-sales day than Black Panther sold in its first month.[183] Within 72 hours, the film generated the biggest amount of pre-sales for any superhero film at AMC Theatres. AMC noted that Infinity War's advance ticket sales were 257.6% ahead of Black Panther's, 751.5% ahead of Captain America: Civil War, and 1,106.5% ahead of Avengers: Age of Ultron during the same time frame.[184] Two weeks before its release, Fandango revealed that advance ticket sales for Infinity War were outpacing the last seven MCU films combined in the same timeframe, and had become the company's top April release. It was also on pace to become the top superhero film, with Fandango's Erik Davis noting, "Infinity War has built up such unprecedented anticipation that it's pacing to break records, the likes of which we have never seen before for a superhero movie."[185] A week before the film released, The Wall Street Journal noted the film had sold more than $50 million worth of advance tickets, behind only The Force Awakens and Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017),[186][163] with Fandango reporting that more than 2,500 showtimes had sold out. On Atom Tickets, Infinity War had the most pre-sale volume, selling 7% higher than The Last Jedi and 250% higher than Black Panther at the same point in their sales. Atom also reported that ticket sales for Infinity War were doubling daily the week of its release, the fastest rate of increase the service has seen for any MCU title.[163]

Critical response
------------------
The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an 84% approval rating based on 395 reviews, and an average rating of 7.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Avengers: Infinity War ably juggles a dizzying array of MCU heroes in the fight against their gravest threat yet, and the result is a thrilling, emotionally resonant blockbuster that (mostly) realizes its gargantuan ambitions."[204] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 68 out of 100, based on 53 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[205] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale,[163] while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it an 87% overall positive score and a 68% "definite recommend".[165]

Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter praised the writers' and directors' ability to balance the large cast of characters, saying, "...writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and directors Anthony and Joe Russo, under the supervision of Marvel Films maestro Kevin Feige, acknowledge the traffic jam of egos and play it for laughs".[206] Owen Gleiberman of Variety concurred, stating, "Infinity War is a brashly entertaining jamboree, structured to show off each hero or heroine and give them just enough to do, and to update their mythologies without making it all feel like homework."[207] Rolling Stone's Peter Travers said the film is "too much of a good thing" and wrote, "The Russo brothers have clearly never learned the concept that less is more. They've used the premise of an Avengers reunion to put on a fireworks explosion of action and laughs that won't quit."[208] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times called it Marvel's "biggest and most ambitious movie yet", but concluded "it's certainly not the best. However, there's plenty of action, humor and heart—and some genuinely effective dramatic moments." Roeper went on to praise the film's cast and Josh Brolin in particular, whom he called "the film's most interesting performance".[209] Gleiberman called Brolin's motion capture performance "supremely effective" and said, "Brolin infuses Thanos with his slit-eyed manipulative glower, so that the evil in this movie never feels less than personal."[207] McCarthy wrote, "Brolin's calm, considered reading of the character bestows this conquering beast with an unexpectedly resonant emotional dimension, making him much more than a thick stick figure of a supervillain." McCarthy also praised the film's action sequences, saying "Infinity War brims with tensely spectacular combat sequences, even if the question of who's going to win each one has that extravagantly arbitrary could-Mighty-Mouse-beat-up-Superman? quality."[206] Gleiberman called the scale of the action, "astonishing",[207] and Travers wrote, "Avengers: Infinity War leaves viewers up in the air, feeling exhilarated and cheated at the same time, aching for a closure that never comes...at least not yet."[208] Josh Spiegel, also of The Hollywood Reporter, said the film takes "a cue from the ending of The Empire Strikes Back in its super-sized finale; this is the equivalent of Han Solo frozen in the carbonite, on steroids."[210]

A. O. Scott of The New York Times criticized the film's reliance on other films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, saying, "Considered on its own, as a single, nearly 2-hour-40-minute movie, Avengers: Infinity War makes very little sense", but conceded that it "was never meant to be viewed or judged in isolation".[211] Richard Brody of The New Yorker agreed, stating, "The insubstantiality of the film isn't due to the infinite yet flimsy malleability of C.G.I. gimmickry but, instead, to the dispersion of its drama throughout the many cinematic installations set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."[212] Stephanie Zacharek of Time said, "[It] isn't really a beginning, but more of a middle or an end with a new piece of yarn attached. You need to have seen and internalized every one of the previous 18 Marvel Cinematic Universe movies to fully get it."[213] Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times called it a "brisk, propulsive, occasionally rousing and borderline-gutsy continuation of a saga that finally and sensibly seems to be drawing to a close", but called its ultimate bid for catharsis "unsuccessful", saying, "Not even the threat of universal annihilation, it seems, will keep this assembly line from chugging ahead with its signature polished, mechanized efficiency."[214] Scott also criticized the action sequences, calling them "tedious and predictable" and writing, "The noisy, bloated spectacles of combat were surely the most expensive parts of the movie, but the money seems less like an imaginative tool than a substitute for genuine imagination."[211] Likewise, Zacharek said, "There's no pacing in Avengers: Infinity War. It's all sensation and no pulse. Everything is big, all of the time."[213]

Audience response
American YouTube personality Tony "Nem" Mitchell watched the film 103 times in theaters, a world record. When Mitchell's streak was gaining media awareness around his 44th viewing, he noted that IMAX reached out to give him 50 free tickets to continue the streak, and the Russo brothers invited him to the sequel's premiere.[215][216][217] Mitchell said this was the way he "want[ed] to support Marvel and the Russo brothers."[215] Seventeen-year-old Kieran Harvey from Staffordshire also watched the film in theaters 100 times. Harvey stated that he "didn't plan on seeing it this many times it just sort of happened" adding that Infinity War "just felt so different to anything I've ever seen before, and I just love it so much so have been going as much as I can!"[218]

The ending of the film sparked various Internet meme reactions,[219] particularly one related to Spider-Man saying he does not feel good as he disintegrates, which was applied to other aspects of pop culture.[220] The website, DidThanosKill.Me was created for fans to see if they would have been spared by Thanos or not.[221] The ending also spawned the creation of the Reddit subreddit, /r/thanosdidnothingwrong. A user within the subreddit suggested that half of the approximately 20,000 subscribers at the time be banned from the subreddit, in order to mimic the events of the film. After the community agreed to the measure, the moderators approached Reddit's administrators to see if the mass ban would even be possible. Once the administrators agreed to the random ban of half the subscribers, it was set to occur on July 9, 2018.[222] Notice of the impending ban made the subreddit's subscribers increase to over 700,000,[223] including both of the Russos who subscribed.[224] Ahead of the ban, Brolin posted a video saying "Here we go, Reddit users," and ending it with a snap.[225] Over 60,000 people watched a live Twitch stream of the ban occurring, which lasted a couple hours.[223] The ban of over 300,000 accounts, which included Anthony Russo, was the largest in Reddit's history.[223][226] Those banned then gathered in the new subreddit, /r/inthesoulstone.[222][223] One Reddit user who participated felt the ban "embodie[d] the spirit of the Internet" with people "banding together, en masse, around something relatively meaningless but somehow decidedly awesome and hilarious."[226] Andrew Tigani of Screen Rant spoke of the ban and how /r/thanosdidnothingwrong "only speaks to how impactful the film has already become to pop culture. It is also a testament to how valuable fan interaction can be via social media."[225]

Sarkar (2018 film)
-------------------

Sarkar (lit. Government) is a 2018 Indian Tamil-language action drama film[3] written and directed by AR Murugadoss, and produced by Kalanithi Maran under the banner Sun Pictures. The dialogues were co-written by Murugadoss and B. Jeyamohan. The film stars Vijay, Keerthy Suresh, Varalaxmi Sarathkumar, Yogi Babu and Radha Ravi. It follows Sundar Ramaswamy, a non-resident Indian (NRI) who arrives in India from the United States to cast his vote in the election, only to find his vote has already been recorded as casted. Ramaswamy raises awareness against electoral fraud among the masses, and decides to contest as a nonpartisian politician in the elections.

Principal photography for Sarkar began in January 2018. Murugadoss collabrated with Vijay for a third time with Sarkar, which was the latter's 62nd film and given the tentative title of Thalapathy 62. In early December 2017, Sun Pictures agreed to produce the film. While Girish Gangadharan handled the cinematography, A. Sreekar Prasad served as the editor. In August, few scenes were shot at Las Vegas. Filming was completed by September 2018. The film's soundtrack, composed by A. R. Rahman with lyrics written by Vivek, received positive reviews.

After various complications, including protests and allegations of plagiarism, Sarkar was released on 6 November 2018, during the week of Diwali. It received mixed reviews; while Vijay's performance was praised, both the screenplay and sequences were criticised. A reference to Jayalalithaa in the film's audio track led to protests by members of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. After lawsuits were registered against the makers, the said allusions were muted. As of 15 November 2018, Sarkar has grossed ₹217.13 crore (US$30 million) worldwide, and has emerged as a commercial success.[2]

Plot
-----
Sundar Ramaswamy is a highly successful non-resident Indian businessman based in the United States, referred to as a "corporate monster" due to his ruthless business dealings. He arrives in Chennai to cast his vote for the Tamil Nadu Legislaative Assembly election. However, he finds out that someone else had already voted in his name. Sundar approaches the Tamil Nadu State Election Commission and demands a stay on the election result for his constituency, an annulment of the fraud elector's vote and the ability to legitimately cast his vote, to which they agree. Sundar raises awareness among the public regarding fraud voting and finds that many people too faced a similar problem to his when trying to vote.

Meanwhile, Sundar rekindles his romance with his estranged sister-in-law's sister Nila, whom he had last met five years ago. His actions bring him into conflict with two influential and corrupt politicians, M. Masilamani, who is the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, and his brother Malarvannan "Rendu". Although Masilamani's party wins the elections, the Election Commission annuls the result based on Sundar's plea and fresh elections are scheduled to take place within the next fifteen days. After attempts are made on his life by Rendu's henchmen, Sundar decides to contest the election against Masilamani as an Independent and resigns from his company to avoid any conflict-of-interest.

Initially unpopular among the masses due to his corporate background, Sundar delivers a speech detailing his rise from a humble fisherman background to a businessman, and gains popular support. He and his supporters gatecrash an event involving the merger of Masilamani's party with the opposition. After Sundar confronts Masilamani regarding his silence on district-related issues, the police brutally beat up Sundar and his supporters. At this juncture, he realises that the entire political system in the state and country needs reform, and decides to contest in all constituencies in Tamil Nadu along with his supporters. Sundar acquires video evidence wherein people who had attempted to expose Masilamani's corruption were killed under mysterious circumstances, and plans to reveal it to the media to discredit Masilamani and have him arrested.

At the same time, Masilamani's daughter Komalavalli "Pappa", based in Canada, arrives in Chennai after finding out that her father and uncle have lost support due to Sundar. She decides to spoil Sundar's reputation and frame him as a corrupt and power-hungry person. She orchestrates a car accident and frames Sundar for it, which causes him to lose considerable public support. She furthers her agenda by killing her father with an overdose of diabetic tablets, so that her party will gain sympathy votes. These crimes ensure that Pappa, the new Chief Ministerial candidate for her party, would likely win the election. Sundar decides against exposing the evidence against Masilamani as he feels that his support will further erode, which was what Pappa intended to accomplish.

On Election Day, Twitter messages generated from one "Muthukumar" allege Sundar has stashed black money in various locations, which further degrades Sundar's reputation. However, unknown to anyone, the tweets were sent by Sundar himself, as Muthukumar was one of those activists killed by Masilamani. Further messages lead to Muthukumar's decomposed body being found, exposing Pappa's lies. Meanwhile, Pappa finds that her guilty mother has decided to expose Pappa's role in Masilamani's death at Masilamani's memorial in front of the media. She arrives at the memorial with her henchmen to stop the expose, but Sundar subdues Pappa's henchmen and her mother's confession is live-streamed, which ensures that the public support is back with Sundar.

Sundar and his supporters win the election, while Pappa and Rendu are arrested for their various crimes. However, Sundar decides against becoming the Chief Minister, and instead chooses one of his supporters- a honest collector- as the next Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu.

Production:
-----------
Following the successful ventures, Thuppakki and Kaththi, A. R. Murugadoss was confirmed to be the director of the 62nd film of actor Vijay. The project, tentatively titled Thalapathy 62, was slated to enter production once Vijay completed Mersal and A. R. Murugadoss completed Spyder.[5][6] Production began in January 2018, with a planned Diwali-2018 release.[7] Girish Gangadharan of Kali, Angamaly Diaries and Solo fame was the cinematographer.[8] Tulasi played the role of Vijay's mother in the film.[9] In mid-November 2017, it was reported that actor Yogi Babu was in talks to play a role in the film and actress Nayanthara was in talks to be the female lead.[10][11] A. R. Rahman was also rumoured to be in talks to compose the music of the film.[12] Sreekar Prasad, who had previously edited Thuppakki and Kaththi was the film's editor.[13]

In early-December 2017, T. Santhanam was confirmed the art director of the film, and following this, it was made official that Sun Pictures was producing the film.[14] Before the title was revealed on 21 June 2018,[15] it was referred to by the media as Thalapathy 62, as it is the 62nd film starring Vijay. Jaswanth Khanna, son of comedian Ramesh Khanna, who had worked as an assistant director, made his acting debut with this film.[16] Keerthy Suresh was later signed to play the female lead role and Varalaxmi Sarathkumar was also confirmed, playing a pivotal role.[17][18][19] Jeyamohan was recruited as writer, and shooting began in January 2018. The team had successfully completed the first and second schedules of the shoot, and begin their third schedule in Las Vegas in early August.[20] Shooting was wrapped up on 5 September, after which dubbing and post production works were carried out.[21]

Music
------
The music and score of the film is composed by A. R. Rahman,[19] and lyricist Vivek penning the songs.[22] The full audio album was launched on 2 October 2018.[23] The album consist of five songs, all penned by lyricist Vivek. The team launched the very first single "Simtaangaran", which received mixed reviews, on 24 September, followed by "Oru Viral Puratchi" on the last day of the same month of September which too received positive reviews. The album in its entirety was made available for download in digital on 2 October. The promotional music event featured dance performances for the songs in the background. The soundtrack album was released and bagged under the Sony Music record label after few days the single track is released.

Sarkar is Rahman's fourth collaboration with actor Vijay, after Udhaya, Azhagiya Tamil Magan and Mersal. The audio release event of the film was conducted in a much peculiar way, where for the very first time the audience were given the privilege of launching the music album online. The audio launch event held a live telecast aired on Sun TV and on their exclusive paid service called SunNXT . Significant crew members took turns in giving a review of their experience being part of the project. Celebrities such as director Atlee turned up that night, as guests. Unlike other music events, Rahman opt out not to perform. Instead trained dancers put a rendition for the beats of his. It transpired that the album was unofficially leaked without the team's consent, ruining the hype built up for album. In essence, the soundtrack was very well received by the public, the general consensus was positive. Indiaglitz gave a 4 out of 5 star rating, but cited: "Sarkar though rich in techno and electronic treatment, finds a winning combo with its amazing lyrics".[24] Studioflicks mentioned "A mix of local and western flavour from A. R. Rahman", giving it a rating of 3.25 out of 5.[25] Behindwoods gave it 2.75 out of 5 stars and stated: "A. R. Rahman goes full-on techno for Sarkar ".[26]

All tracks written by Vivek.

Release
--------
Sarkar was released on 6 November 2018, during the week of Diwali.[27] The film opened to mixed reviews from critics, with praise for Vijay's screen presence; however, the screenplay and sequences were criticised.[28]

Political controversies
Following release, the Tamilnadu government accused the filmmakers and actor Vijay that they are inciting the people by targeting the ruling government in some scenes and defaming former chief minister J Jayalalitha by naming the main antagonist with her original name Komalavalli[29]. This led to numerous protests by AIADMK party members at theatres where the film is screened and vandalism of banners. AIADMK accused Sun Pictures which is owned by Kalanidhi Maran, who is the grandson of former Chief Minister M Karunanidhi of DMK of targeting the government.[30] Following threat of lawsuits from the government, the filmmakers accepted to cut a scene and mute references of Komalavalli in the audio track.[31]

Plagiarism allegations
Writer Varun Rajendran accused Murugadoss of plagiarising Sengol, a story he had registered with the South Indian Film Writer's Association in 2007.[32][33][34] After K. Bhagyaraj, the head of the Association concluded that Sarkar's script was not original, the matter was taken to court, where the judge M. Sundar said that Sun Pictures have to acknowledge Rajendran in the opening credits, and pay him compensation of ₹30 lakh (US$42,000); Sun Pictures and Murugadoss assented.[35]

Detailed Plot
--------------
Ram (the lead male protagonist) is a happy-go-lucky freelance travel photographer whose passion makes him travel all over India. An introduction to Ram's life (the very start of the movie) is aptly summarized in the beautiful song 'The Life of Ram'. This song showcases the travel exploits of Ram such as an underwater scuba diving and photo shoot in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Rajasthan Desert expedition at Jaisalmer, wonderful views of Rohtang Pass and capturing day to day life in and around Calcutta and Howrah Bridge to name a few. At the end of the song, the actual story begins with Ram instructing his students about photography and the nuances of taking great pictures in a temple in Kumbakonam. At the end of the day, Ram is tired and asks if any one of them knows driving. Prabha volunteers first, mentioning that she can drive. Ram asks her to get ready early next morning for the drive back to Chennai. Prabha starts driving early next morning with Ram fast asleep in the passenger seat. Sometime, near the strike of dawn, Ram gets up and sees around the place and surroundings. Prabha informs him that they are currently in Thanjavur and they had to route through Thanjavur and Trichy to reach Chennai due to traffic issues in the original route. She also mentions to Ram that Google maps is switched on. Ram asks Prabha to ignore Google and drive as per his instructions. They drive through Thanjavur main city when Ram gets excited seeing the same. He reveals to Prabha that he is from the same city. He gets excited and points out the corporation bus stand mentioning that his parents landed up here, first after their marriage. He excitement continues and he explains to Prabha about other things that come in the way of their drive (such as the Government Hospital where he was born, the first shopping complex that came up in their city and a bakery that was very famous that made you hungry anytime). As they are further driving through the city, he shows Prabha a place mentioning thats where his old home would have been long before. When Prabha asks Ram if she needs to stop the car, he asks her to continue driving since he feels he may have to talk to people if they were to stop. As they continue the drive, the car passes by a small crossing over a river stream and Ram gets super excited seeing the same. He starts to say something to Prabha but then immediately keeps quiet.

The scene shifts to Ram and Prabha's car stopping in front of All Saints Matriculation School. Ram sees the facade of the school building and sees Kaval Deivam (watch man) sleeping in his chair, in front of the main gate. He asks Prabha to drive fast towards him and stop a few meters away. When Kaval Deivam is shocked and gets up from his chair seeing the car just stopping a few meters away, Ram gets down from the car and introduces himself as K. Ramachandram of X 'C' batch. He immediately recognizes Ram and they chat over tea. Ram asks for permission to see his school and enters the school building. As he walks through the main campus, he is overcome by old memories. He looks at the roll of honor and proudly announces that his name is present there. Then he goes up to his classroom and sits on two different benches for sometime (the significance becomes clearer in the later part of the story). He then comes to the playground and sits on a bench, introspecting about the past, when Kaval Deivam comes and sits next to him. He asks Ram if he is in touch with his friend Murali (the first of Ram's three best friends in school). Ram mentions otherwise, citing work commitments. At the same time he pulls out his phone, dial Murali's number and asks Kaval Deivam to exchange a few words. After speaking to Kaval Deivam, Murali asks Ram what he is doing in school and Ram explains how the school looks absolutely the same even after 10-12 years after their pass out. Murali corrects him that it is 20 years and not 12 since they were 1996 batch of students and now it is 2016. On the drive back to Chennai, Ram feels nostalgic and wishes to connect with his old friends. He calls up Subhashini (second of his three best friends in school and a literally a brother to her) and asks for the contact numbers of all others so that he can talk to them. She says that connecting individually is not a great idea. Murali mentions to him that there is a WhatsApp group of the 96 batch of students and that he is the admin of the group. He tells Ram that he will add him to the group and Ram thanks him for the same. As soon as Ram gets added to the group, he starts messaging and inquiring about all. One of the school mates pings a X Standard class photo of their batch. Ram zooms into the photo and looks at one of his classmates (later revealed as his childhood sweet heart, Jaanu). He mentions that he wished to get in touch with all initially, but now after the chat, he wishes to see all. Many start pinging that they need to meet up soon when Murali mentions that since it has been 20 years after their pass out, it would be a good idea to have a school reunion. All of them are excited with the suggestion and everyone on the chat decide that they will meet in Chennai exactly 2 months later.

The scene next shifts to the reunion day in Chennai after 2 months in a resort. All of the batch mates start arriving and meeting with each other. Murali is busy giving driving directions to the resort to folks who dial him up. Subhashini (Subha henceforth) is eagerly waiting for Ram. Sathish (Ram's third friend and his bench mate in school) mentions to her that he has already called Ram thrice and that he is on his way. Sometime later Ram arrives and everyone is excited to see him. All the classmates interact with each other and Ram. They discuss old memories, hold games, fun events and take pictures. Then Subha, Ram, Murali and Sathish sit together in a table to catch up. Subha asks Murali if all have arrived so that they can order dinner to be served. Murali mentions that 4 more people need to arrive and that he has given directions to three of them. He then realizes that had a slip of tongue with the number of people. When Subha presses him about 4th person, he tries to communicate to her visually to keep quiet by telling her its something to do with Ram. Subha keeps pressing him about the identity of the 4th person. When Ram joins Subha in asking Murali about the 4th person, he takes a pause and mentions cautiously that it is Jaanu. The entire scene shifts to pin drop silence and focused on Ram who takes a very deep breath and introspects.

The next scene shifts to the background of Ram's school days. The events are narrated by Ram in the background. The memory opens with Jaanu welcoming the Xth C batch of students with a song. Ram mentions that singing was everything to Jaanu. He reveals that since the earliest days of childhood (when one starts to read and write), they have been together. He narrates that he liked Jaanu and her songs and that she also liked him. He also reveals that his affection for Jaanu was responsible for his attendance being over 90% in school. Without knowing what exactly she meant to him, he narrates that whenever he prayed, the only prayer he asked was for Jaanu to be within his eyesight always. One day in school, when the teacher takes the class attendance, he sees that Jaanu is absent. When this continues on the next day, he asks Subha (Jaanu's bench mate) about the reason for her absence. Subha is not aware of the same and this makes Ram upset. During the interval Subha conveys to Ram that one other classmate has told her an approximate location of Jaanu's home. After school, both Ram and Subha cycle through the neighborhood, searching for Jaanu's house but they cannot find it. Ram is enthusiastic to continue the search but Subha requests him to turn back since its already late and tells him that she will definitely come on Monday. Ram reluctantly agrees and turns back. He finds the weekend passing slow. He is super excited on Monday morning and arrives early to school. He sees Jaanu come into the class very sick and not completely recovered. He reveals that on any other day he would have been the first person to go and inquire about her health, but something was preventing him from approaching her that day. Except him, all others inquire about Jaanu's health. During the class, Jaanu slowly turns back and smiles at Ram. Ram reveals that while he could not explain that feeling (which made him so very happy and excited), the best of his limited knowledge told him that this was the first love of their X standard batch. His love for Jaanu makes him very shy and he has difficulty seeing her in the eye or having a conversation with her. He gets nervous whenever he sees Jaanu. But he cannot keep this away from Subha and reveals to her. Sathish finds out about Ram's love for Jaanu and Murali comes to know about the same as well. Days pass in joy. Whenever Jaanu is asked to sing a song in class, Ram requests through various means (but not directly to Jaanu) that she sing one of his favorites 'Yamunai Attriley' from the blockbuster film Dalapathy. Jaanu loves to tease Ram and she never sings that song. Ram narrates happily that Jaanu was a stubborn donkey who never obliged him with his favorite song. On Jaanu's birthday, she comes to the class and asks Subha where is Ram. When Ram enters the class and sees Jaanu, he tries to get away when his friends pin him down. Jaanu approaches him and asks him to take chocolates. He stammers to wish her and can only bring out the word Happy. Jaanu loves to tease Ram and asks him if he meant to say Happy Diwali. After much effort he wishes her Happy Birthday. She then observes that he is sweating a lot. She asks Ram what happened now that he is so nervous to make him sweat so much. Subha in Ram's defense tells Jaanu that her brother is a sports man and so he is sweating. When mentioning this, Subha casually places her palm on Ram's chest and finds it thumping hard. Subha cannot understand what is happening and is surprised. When Jaanu asks what is happening, Subha tells Jaanu to check out for herself and places her hand on Ram's chest. Ram faints in the class, much to the annoyance of Subha who feels that is is shameful that he fainted in front of a girl. Jaanu is taken aback that someone could love her so much. Then, the final exams for X standard exams come. After the last day of the exam, Sathish teases Ram mentioning that he and Ram wont be seeing each other for 2 months (meaning Ram and Jaanu). Murali also teases Subha mentioning how long will she keep addressing Jaanu by her name and not as her sister-in-law. Ram and Jaanu cycle slowly towards their homes and they stop midway on the crossing over the river stream (shown initially when Ram was driving through Thanjavur and stops short of explaining to Prabha). Jaanu asks Ram if she can leave and he does not say anything. She drives away and Ram is upset standing there. After a couple of minutes, Jaanu comes back and sprays ink on his white shirt and telling him not to forget her. She wishes him happy holidays and goes home. Ram is extremely happy.

The scene shifts to the present in the resort. Ram has moved away from the table with Subha, Murali and Sathish. He is very nervous standing a few feet away. Murali, Subha and Sathish ask him to come back but he does not agree. They cannot understand why he is still nervous and behaving like a X standard student. Subha then asks Murali how he knew Jaanu was coming. He reveals that after repeated messages and phone calls to Jaanu, to which she did not attend or respond, he got frustrated and left calling her. Then he mentions that today morning he got a message from her telling that she is coming. He tells Subha that he did not reveal about this because Jaanu had to come all the way from Singapore and he was not sure about the same. It is evening now and Jaanu (the lead female protagonist and Ram's childhood sweet heart, portrayed by Trisha) is introduced in the movie as coming into to the resort. Everyone is excited to meet Jaanu and exchange pleasantries. Then she meets Subha and both are very happy to see each other. While Sathish, Murali and Subha speak with her, Jaanu seems to listen, but Subha can clearly see that Jaanu's attention is elsewhere and that her eyes are scanning the whole place. Subha asks Sathish to bring Ram to the table, but Ram is too nervous to come. When Sathish comes and reveals this back to Subha, Jaanu is surprised with their hushed conversation and asks whats wrong. Subha reluctantly mentions that Ram has come and that he his hiding near the play area. The entire scene shifts to pin drop silence and focused on Jaanu who gets very emotional. She gets up and involuntarily walks towards Ram in a clear state of shock.

The scene shifts back to the flashback of the first day of XI Standard. Jaanu comes to school happy. She searches in the class room for Ram while uninterestingly talking to others. During the class attendance, Ram's name is not mentioned and Murali asks the teacher about the missing name of K. Ramachandran (Ram). The teacher tells the name is not in the attendance register and asks Murali to check in the front office. It is understood that Ram has already taken Transfer Certificate from the school. Jaanu is extremely upset. Her feelings are revealed through the background score 'Yean Yedhu Kuraamal'. Murali and Sathish drive to Ram's home after school and find that it is locked. They come back to school and reveal to Subha and Jaanu that Ram's father had financial difficulties and had to sell their home and that they have moved to Chennai overnight. They also tell that Ram did not know about this plan until the day they moved out. Jaanu is heart broken. She gets into a shell, keeps away from all, and just manages to complete her XII standard. On the day of results, she comes and sits in Ram's bench in X Standard and moves out extremely sad from school.

The scene shifts to the resort with Jaanu coming towards Ram, charged with old emotions. She sees Ram (who is already very nervous). She asks Ram if he recognizes her and tells she is Jaanu. Ram finds difficulty to converse and answers using minimal words. When she tells him that it is still unbelievable for her that they would meet this way after 22 years, she can find Ram sweating profusely. Jaanu intuitively places her palm on his chest (as she did to him in school) and Ram faints once again. Once he has recovered, Shuba chastises Jaanu (jokingly) to make Ram feel better. She also asks Ram if he inquired about Jaanu and her 2 year old kid. Subha also hints to Murali and Sathish to move away from the table so that she can talk to Jaanu. Jaanu then playfully asks Subha to move away from the table as well so that she can talk to Ram. Ram gets Jaanu her dinner to the table. With just she and Ram around, Jaanu silently eats her dinner. Half way through, she offers the rest of the food to Ram and asks him to complete the plate fully. Murali and Subha are now nervous, feeling that Ram and Jaanu have started off exactly where they left in school. Murali then makes a speech thanking everyone for coming, while mentioning that others who could not make it missed an opportunity of a lifetime. Before concluding the events of the day, he requests the class favorite of all, Jaanu, to come up and say a few words. Jaanu, already full of emotions, mentions that she is very happy and feels that her age has decreased by half. She reveals that she came to the party expecting all to have changed, but nothing having happened as such. She reveals that she feels like wearing the blue and white uniform once again and going to school with all of them. She is requested by Sathish to sing a song. Meanwhile, Ram as he always does, asks Murali to request her to sing his favorite song, but as usual, Jaanu sings a different song (but a very moving song expressing her emotions and state of mind). The party ends with picture sessions but it can be seen that Ram and Jaanu are not interested in any events and just looking out for each other. All depart. Only the main characters (Ram, Jaanu, Subha, Murali and Sathish) remain, waiting for their car to arrive to drive off. Subha mentions to Murali that she has a severe headache and requests him to get her a coffee when driving back home.

The group of five have coffee in a restaurant when Subha asks Jaanu about her return plans to Singapore and also to show them a picture of her daughter. When Ram sees Jaanu's daughter, Sathish teases him telling Jaanu that Ram is flirting with her daughter in front of her. Subha casually mentions to Ram about the importance of marriage at the right time so that he need not flirt with young girls. Jaanu is shocked to learn that Ram is still not married and asks Ram why has he not married. Sensing the sudden turn of conversation, Murali asks Ram to wait in the car and asks all to disperse. Subha feels she messed up by bringing up the topic of marriage. Murali asks Subha to drop Jaanu first when they drive back to prevent any undue tensions. Jaanu is seen angrily asking Sathish about this question and upset that everyone is avoiding her question. On the drive back, Ram tells Subha that he will drop her first and then Jaanu. Subha asks Ram not to think too much and drop her soon and drive back home. Jaanu is amused by Ram's actions and she expresses the same through her eyes.

When Jaanu and Ram are driving alone now after dropping Subha, Jaanu teases Ram, asking if he will talk to her only in Subha's absence. Then she seriously asks Ram why he has not married. Ram does not have a convincing answer. Jaanu begs him to tell the reason, mentioning that even if she was the reason, it is fine, but she needs to hear the same. Ram drives into the hotel where Jaanu is staying and tells her that her destination has come. He adds that he will pick her up in the morning and drop her to the airport and gives his number to her. Jaanu is extremely upset and she goes into the hotel and her room. Her emotions are conveyed through the background score 'Vasantha Kaalangal'. In the room, Jaanu gets emotional. She calls back Ram immediately and asks him how far he has gone back. Ram tells Jaanu that he is exactly at the same place where he left her. Jaanu runs back towards his car. She expresses her lovable anger to Ram by punching him, mentioning that she waited 22 years to talk to him. Ram apologizes and they go out to a drive. Jaanu is again happy in the car and asks Ram to drive somewhere. When driving, Subha calls Ram. Ram asks Jaanu to be silent and conveys to Subha that he has just dropped Jaanu in her room and going back to his home. Subha asks if Jaanu conveyed anything to him and he replies telling just a few questions about his parents. Subha asks Ram not to worry about anything and to have a nice sleep. She then calls Jaanu to cross check where she is. Jaanu mentions that she is in the hotel room and she has a connecting flight in the morning. Subha hangs up after asking Jaanu to stay in touch.

Ram then reveals to Jaanu that he called her out in a hurry and has never done this before. He requests Jaanu to choose a place. Jaanu asks him to go to a salon. At the salon, she requests the barber to cut his hair and beard to make him look like a X Standard boy. She is very happy seeing a transformed Ram after the cut and shave. They come out of the salon and in the car parking lot, she asks Ram to remove his outer shirt and he reluctantly agrees. She sees that Ram is extremely shy. To pull Ram's leg, she asks him if he is still a virgin. Ram gets red faced and tries to avoid the question, but Jaanu enjoys Ram's shyness in answering the question. She then asks him if no one had fallen for him. Ram reveals that there was a girl in college who was interested him, but he tried all reasons to avoid her which was futile. Jaanu prods him to continue further. Ram tells that finally he had to tell the girl the truth (about he loving Jaanu), after which she left him. Jaanu gets serious now and tells Ram that after he left X Standard without telling anyone, she could neither forget him nor his love. She adds that her studies went for a toss, and she barely managed to pass XII standard. The fear of her parents getting her married prompted her to complete a degree. Added to this, the challenge of her elder sister eloping in love marriage made matters worse at home. After this incident, she reveals that her alliance got fixed in 2 months. Due to the hatred her father harbored for her elder sister, she could not do much. She reveals that in her heart of hearts she had a feeling on the day of marriage that her Ram would come and take her away, but in reality, only her marriage happened. She tells Ram that she was shattered after the same. But whenever she felt low, the only thing that came to mind was the happy face of K. Ramachandran (aka Ram). Ram is dead serious on hearing this. They drive back to the hotel. On reaching the same, Jaanu apologizes to Ram, telling that she did not meant to hurt him. She mentions to him that these were something that she always planned to tell him if she were to meet him someday and that she had no one else to share this burden with. Ram is in a state of absolute shock. When gently prodded by Jaanu, Ram hesitatingly asks Jaanu if she does not remember the day he came to her college and gave her a letter, asking to meet her. Jaanu gets very serious and asks Ram not to joke. Ram tells her seriously that he had indeed come to meet her.

The scene shifts to Ram and Murali in their college days driving to Thanjavur and waiting in front of a ladies college. They approach one of the girls and asks her about Janaki Devi in Computer Science Department (Jaanu). Murali tells the girl that Ram and Jaanu are school lovers and they have come to meet Jaanu. They request the lady to pass this message to Jaanu telling her to convey that K. Ramachandran (Ram) is waiting outside. The girl comes to Jaanu and forgets the name K. Ramachandran and instead mentions that a boy is waiting downstairs to meet her. Jaanu sees down and gets furious. She tells the girl that if she ever comes carrying the message of love from someone, she would get a tight slap. The girl conveys this message (about Jaanu being extremely upset and angry on hearing about them) back to Murali and Ram waiting down. Ram thinks for sometime and asks the girl for one last favor, asking her to convey to Jaanu that henceforth they will not trouble her. Murali asks Ram not to assume anything and sort out things after college, but Ram tells that anything could have changed in three years and its best that they do not disturb her. They return back to Chennai.

The scene shifts to the present in the car and Jaanu is emotionally broken and completely devastated. She runs out of the car to her room saying nothing. Ram senses that she is not all right and follows her. On the way to her room, he can see that her sandals are in the corridor and carries them to her room. The hotel room door is open and he enters the room. When he calls for her, Jaanu cries from the bathroom asking him not to enter. She sobs uncontrollably and reveals in a broken voice that she never saw him the other day in college. When she tries to chastise herself, Ram enters the bathroom, consoles her, and tells her its OK. Jaanu is inconsolable and she cries mentioning that the never saw him the other day in college. The scene shifts back to the same day in college when Ram and Murali went to meet her, but shown from Jaanu's perspective. When she is told that a boy is waiting downstairs to meet her, she sees a different boy standing down (in addition to Ram and Murali whom she did not see), who was supposedly following her and had a liking for her. She got annoyed on seeing this person and reacted the way she did as was communicated previously.

The scene shifts to the present in the hotel room, where Ram and Jaanu are sitting (with Jaanu still sorrowful and devastated). Ram tells her that the fault was his because he should have waited to talk to her the other day in college, instead of assuming that she did not like him. He also feels that its was better the truth was not revealed so that each one believed the past and it could have been good. But Jaanu tells that this was for the good (even though heartbreaking) since she came to know the truth that Ram was also looking out for her all these days. Jaanu partially regains her composure and asks Ram how he knew in which college she was studying when he had moved over to Chennai 3 years before. Ram tells her that he had informants in places to get updates about her. He reveals that except the mistake of assuming that she hated him, he knew everything about her. Jaanu challenges him to reveal what he knew about her and warning him not to bluff. Ram shoots off a rapid fire update of events in her life as he had traced over the past years (mentioning things such as her X Marks, XII Marks, her favorite deity, how she stopped singing after he left school, how she wanted to enroll into Tamil Literature but her father wanted her to do computer science, how a boy who was following her had his mouth broken and that issue had become a police case, how she got sick with typhoid both times before her public exams and so on). Jaanu is absolutely shocked and amazed to hear this. She smiles and asks him to continue. Then Ram mentions that during her college day was the first time he saw her in a Saree. Jaanu smiles and nodes in acknowledgement. He mentions that while she was nervous that the Saree would give away, she was also shy that others were watching her. He tells how breathtakingly beautiful she was. When Jaanu prods him to tell how, Ram tells in sign language that she was good enough to be taken away and married. Jaanu smiles in spite of her agony and asks him to enact his sign language once again. Both are laughing at those wonderful memories when Ram tells Jaanu that the next time he saw her in a Saree was on her wedding day. Jaanu is devastated when Ram reveals that he was there on the day of her wedding as she had dreamed of, but did not have the courage to wait till the end of ceremony. Jaanu is heartbroken and sobs, but tries to come to terms with it. Both order coffee for room service. Ram tells Jaanu that its getting late for her and asks her to sleep well and that he will pick her up early in the morning and drop her at the airport. When he tries to leave the room, Jaanu calls him back and tells him that it took 22 years for her to see his idiotic face once again for which she has to be grateful to the almighty. She tells him that she will pass on her thanks to God later, but today all that she wants is, to talk and spend time with him. Ram agrees. Both Ram and Jaanu step out of the hotel and walk in the streets of Chennai and board the train to airport, all the while talking and laughing about old memories and events that happened in their life, during the last 22 years. This is beautifully handled with the background score 'Thaabangaley'. When the train nears the airport, Ram's and Jaanu's expressions change from happiness to melancholy, on seeing the airport.

They get off the train and get into a restaurant. Ram is shocked to see his students coming towards the hotel. He tells Jaanu that if they were caught together by his students, it will be a problem. He tells her that he will wait in the bathroom and asks her to call him back once his students leave. He is unsuccessful and the students meet him in the restaurant and they find out he has Jaanu with him which they presume to be his wife. Jaanu acknowledges the same and invites them over to talk much to the dismay of Ram. One of the students, whose birthday they came to celebrate, ask Jaanu about their love story and who proposed first. Jaanu reveals that Ram did the same and she immediately accepted. The students request as a birthday wish to Jaanu to tell them about her acceptance of Ram's love. Jaanu tells them she was all happy and smiling in school when Ram left her abruptly after X standard and they did not see each other for 3 years. Then Jaanu proceeds to narrate the flashback on the day when Ram had traveled to meet her. She tells Ram came to her college and had asked to meet her. In this sequence of flashback, it is revealed as Ram traveled to college alone and the girl correctly mentions to Jaanu that K. Ramachandran is waiting downstairs to see her (instead of a boy that happened in reality). Then Jaanu proceeds to tell the students that from that point on, whatever happened was something she craved that would happen in her dreams. Then she proceeds to narrate in direct speech that her Ram after all these years had come for his Jaanu. Even with her legs being weak, without her control she was running down the corridor to meet Ram. When she saw him downstairs, instead of asking some tough questions that she had planned and rehearsed all these years to ask him, if she were to eventually meet him sometime, she could not say anything and fell into his arms. This event (that never happened but improvised by Jaanu based on the original events that Ram mentioned earlier) has been beautifully characterized by the background score 'Kaadhaley Kaadhaley'. The scene comes back to the present with Jaanu deep in thoughts of her own narration to Ram's students and her eyes moist. Ram asks the students to leave telling its very late in the night.

Ram and Jaanu come out of the hotel. Jaanu asks Ram about the next destination. Ram reluctantly tells Jaanu if he may ask her something. Jaanu is super surprised that Ram has finally something to ask. Ram very hesitatingly mentions that since the hotel is very far off, they could go to him home. Jaanu gets very angry and asks Ram what does he think of her and her character. Ram feels extremely upset and tells that he did not mean in a wrong way and promises to take her back to the hotel in a car. Jaanu then asks him about the celestial damsels in Hindu Mythology who used to upset the penance of Sage Vishwamitra. She teases Ram mentioning that, even if they were to be alone with him, he will not do anything more, but take good care of them and hand them over back the same way as they came to him. Both proceed to Ram's apartment.

It rains heavily as they travel and both are drenched when they reach the apartment. Jaanu is happy seeing Ram's apartment and compliments him for the same. She asks him for the way to the bathroom to change over. Ram hands her over a set of clothes to change and prepares tea for both of them. While he gets their drink, Jaanu tells Ram that she needs to say something to him and that he has to listen. She proceeds by telling him that he has to marry and have a family of his own. She tells him that she has to pamper his kids and see if their nose resembles his features and feel happy about it. She tells him she wants to meet his wife first and tell her in no uncertain terms that a man as good as Ram is very difficult to get and that she better take good care of him. She chokes telling that she will say this one day to his wife. Ram asks Jaanu if she will have something to eat since she did not eat properly at the party or at the hotel. She tells him that she is not hungry but Ram tells her that he is hungry. Jaanu cooks a light porridge. When both are eating the same, Ram asks Jaanu if she is happy. She tells him that she has never been happier before. Ram tells her that he is not asking now but if she is happy in general. Jaanu tells Ram that is was very difficult for her in the beginning when she got married and went to Singapore. She tells that everyday she used to stand in front of god and cry. She continues telling that her husband is a good father to her daughter and he understands her without her revealing much. She summarizes telling that, she is peaceful (as more appropriate to being happy). She also tells that she feels something now, but which she won't reveal. The power shuts down and Ram asks her to be wherever she is seated while he gets the emergency light. As Ram gets the lamp, Jaanu finally sings his favorite song 'Yamunai Aatriley'.

Ram then takes Jaanu to show an old suitcase which consists of old memories from school days. She is very happy to see the same. He shows her the shirt that she had splashed with ink on the last day of their exams in X standard. She is surprised to see her own Dupatta that Ram had flicked from her in school for her remembrance. He then proceeds to show her a rose flower that she had kept in school, that he had preserved all these days. Jaanu then sees a letter inside a book that Ram prevents her from seeing. She asks him if it was a love letter to which he replies in the negative. She gets excited and asks him if it was a poem for her to which he replies in the positive but shy to read to her. She coaxes Ram telling no one else would write a poem on her except him and asks him to read while she gets up and sleeps on his bed. She falls asleep when Ram narrates the poem. Ram lies down on the floor. Jaanu gets up after sometime and then asks Ram to come over and sit next to her and give details about him so that she can set up a matrimonial profile for him. He tells her that after liking a person like Jaanu he cannot marry any other girl. Jaanu tells him that if she after loving K. Ramachandran (Ram) married M. Saravanan, it is definitely possible. He reluctantly gives her the details. It is shown that it is 315 AM now and Jaanu asks if it is time to leave. Ram tells they have 15 minutes more. Jaanu tells about one of Ram's students telling her at the coffee shop that their teacher Ram was a very nice person and asking her to take good care of Ram. Jaanu tells that while the first part is obvious, she has no clue about how to take good care of Ram. Ram tells Jaanu its time to leave and they start back to the hotel. Jaanu starts to get sad and emotional knowing that she has to leave Chennai very soon and that she has to part from Ram. They come back to the hotel and she packs up from her room and checks out. She is devastated by now thinking of the inevitable. Jaanu's emotions are wonderfully expressed using the background score 'Iruvanga Theevai'. Ram and Jaanu reach the airport. Ram gives Jaanu her baggage and asks her to check in. She cries telling Ram that she will spend some more time before going in. Ram in order to make her feel better, gets a ticket for the domestic connection of her flight to Trichy (through to Singapore) so that he can enter the boarding area and be with her for some more time. Both proceed to the gate. After a few minutes the boarding call is announced. Jaanu holds Ram's hands tightly. He is also upset. Jaanu looks at Ram and sobs uncontrollably. She then makes her way into the flight. Ram is equally upset but does not show his emotions in front of Jaanu, but cries on the way back to his apartment. While the sun is rising as he is standing on his corridor, he sees Jaanu's clothes that he had put to dry the previous night when she visited his apartment. Ram cleanly folds the dress and puts them along with his stained shirt and Jaanu's Dupatta in the suitcase along with other memories and shuts the suitcase. The movie ends with rolling credits.
